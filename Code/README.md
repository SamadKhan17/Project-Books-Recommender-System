# Recommender System - Jupyter Notebook

This notebook (Recommender_System.ipynb) contains the full implementation of the book recommendation system, from data loading and exploration to model building and evaluation.

Notebook Overview
1. Data Loading

Loads the dataset containing user ratings, book details, and user demographic information.
Prepares the data for analysis and model training.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Examines the dataset, including missing values, distributions, and patterns in the user ratings.
Performs data cleaning and feature engineering to improve the quality of the data for modeling.

3. Model Building
Implements collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to recommend books.
Trains models using the user-item interaction matrix and other features from the dataset.

4. Model Evaluation
Evaluates the performance of the recommendation models using relevant metrics.
Fine-tunes the model based on evaluation results to improve recommendation accuracy.

How to Use

Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment (locally or in Google Colab).

Follow the steps sequentially to load data, explore the dataset, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

The notebook is designed to be run end-to-end without any modifications.
